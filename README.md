# Haskelly

Haskelly is a VS Code extension that provides complete support for casual and expert Haskell development. This includes:
* Code highlight
* Code snippets
* Type hovers
* Code completion
* Running Haskell inside the editor using either GHCi, runHaskell or Stack build
* Testing all the prop functions in a file with QuickCheck or Stack test


## Features

### Code highlight
Proper code highlight for Haskell code based on [Haskell TextMate](https://github.com/textmate/haskell.tmbundle) and for Cabal files thanks to [Justus Adam](https://github.com/JustusAdam/language-haskell/blob/master/syntaxes/cabal.tmLanguage).

### Code snippets
Snippets for the most popular functions such as `map` or `fold` and other structures like `data` or `newtype`. 
For the tokens which have a snippets, Haskelly will show both the suggestion and the snippet. If you want to disable this behaviour and force Haskelly to only provide the snippet, set the configuration `haskelly.snippets.important` to `true`. Go to the [Extension Settings](## Extension Settings) section to learn how to add your own snippets.

### Type hovers
Hover on top of an identifier and Haskelly will tell you what's its type.

### Code completion
Intelligent code completion which takes into account functions and constants defined in the opened file as well as the Haskell standard library and any imported modules.

### Running Haskell
The extension allows three ways of executing Haskell using the integrated terminal inside VS Code:
* GHCi: you can call all the functions declared in the file providing the arguments. The extension calls `stack ghci` in the background.

* Run file: looks for a main function and executes it. The extension uses `stack runhaskell` under the hood.

* Stack run: runs the Stack project defined in the root folder. The extension runs `stack run` which uses the [stack-run](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stack-run) package.

### Testing Haskell
Easily run [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) on all the functions that start with the prefix `prop_` in the currently opened file. If working in a Stack project, Haskelly will run `stack test`.

## Demo 

Watch a demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3x64iz5xDk).

## Requirements
* [Stack](https://www.haskellstack.org). If you don't know about it, Stack is the best Haskell package manager. If you still use Cabal, check out Stack. After installing Stack and adding it to your `PATH`, run `$ stack setup`. This will install the GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) and GHCi.

* Stack packages (installed locally if working inside a Stack project):
    * Intero package for code completion. To install it globally: `$ stack install intero` or `$ stack build intero` if working on a Stack project.
    * QuickCheck package for running `QuickCheck`. To install it: `$ stack install QuickCheck`.
    * stack-run package for running `stack run`. To install it: `$ stack install stack-run`.


## Extension Settings

Haskelly is fully customizable. Just add any of these properties in the preferences file (Code -> Preferences -> Workspace Settings (settings.json))
* `haskelly.codeCompletion`: set to `false` to disable code completion
* `haskelly.buttons.ghci`: set to `false` to hide the `GHCi` button in the bottom bar
* `haskelly.buttons.runfile`: set to `false` to hide the `Run file` button in the bottom bar
* `haskelly.buttons.quickcheck`: set to `false` to hide the `QuickCheck` button in the bottom bar
* `haskelly.buttons.stackRun`: set to `false` to hide the `Stack run` button in the bottom bar
* `haskelly.buttons.stackTest`: set to `false` to hide the `Stack test` button in the bottom bar
* `haskelly.snippets.important` set to `true` to hide code completion for which there's a snippet.
* `haskelly.snippets.custom` add your custom snippets following the structure of this [file](https://github.com/haskelly-dev/Haskelly/tree/master/languages/snippets/haskell.json).
